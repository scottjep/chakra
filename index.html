  <p> The human body contains hundreds of locations where there is focused and concentrated energy.There are, however, seven major energy centers, commonly referred to as "chakras." 
Chakra is a Sanskrit word which means "wheel." The chakras are similar to wheels in that they are spinning vortexes of energy. They are centers of force located within our etheric body, through which we receive, transmit, and process life energies.Each chakra in the body is recognized as a focal point for life-force relating to spiritual, physical, emotional, and mental energies. The chakras are the network through which the mind, body, and spirit interact as one holistic system. <p>

  <p> The seven major chakras correspond to specific aspects of our consciousness and have their own individual characteristics and functions. Each has a corresponding relationship to one of the various glands of the body's endocrine system, as well as to one of the seven colors of the rainbow spectrum.The main purpose in working with and understanding the chakras is to create integration and wholeness within ourselves.In this way we bring the various aspects of our consciousness from the physical to the spiritual, into a harmonious relationship. Ultimately, we begin to recognize that the various aspects of ourselves all work together, and that each aspect is as much a part of the whole as the others.We must be able to acknowledge, integrate, and accept all levels of our being.
To help us in the process of our unfolding it is most important to understand that the chakras are doorways for our consciousness. They are the doorways through which emotional, mental, and spiritual force flow into physical expression. They are openings through which our attitudes and belief systems enter into and create our mind/body structure. The energy created from our emotional and mental attitudes runs though the chakras and is distributed to our cells, tissues and organs. Realizing this brings tremendous insight into how we ourselves affect our bodies, minds, and circumstances for better or for worse. <p>
   
  <p> To understand the chakras and their relationship to our consciousness, is to better understand ourselves. Understanding ourselves will enable us to make our choices and decisions from a place of balance and awareness, rather than being blindly influenced by forces we do not understand.<p>
